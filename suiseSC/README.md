## Hi, everyone. 
## Welcome to Suise.

Suise is a web3 Vault + Social media app that was built during the Sui Campus Hackathon (DEC. 2025) for the Sui Ecosystem.

It is a web3 version of Google Photos + Snapchat.

# What's the catch?

Users get to: 
* own their photos, 
* create albums, 
* transfer ownership of albums, 
* co-own an album,
* create streaks,
* and many more, all on the app!

Users get non-fungible tokens (NFTs) when they:
* transfer ownership of albums, 
* co-own an album,
* create the most streaks, per week!
